   Interns for the industry!

   To boldly go!
   
   A simple, little web application to manage the requirements for completing student internships.
   
** foundation
   In the course of "Managing Technical Teams" during Winter Quarter 2012 at the Univesity of Washington, Tacoma, a small group formed to automate the existing "paper" process followed by students, faculty advisors, industry sponsors and administrative staff to complete internships.
   
** considerations
   This application is intended to be the [[http://www.artima.com/intv/simplest.html]["simplest thing that could possibly work"]]
   
** resources
   - install [[http://nodejs.org/][node.js]], [[http://www.postgresql.org/download/][postgres]] and [[http://git-scm.com/download][git]]
   - at a command prompt: 
     #+begin_src sh
     git clone https://github.com/spaceshipoperator/redshirts.git

     cd redshirts

     npm install

     #+end_src
   - build the database (with script that will be provided)
   - start the app with `node app.js`

** implementation
   - [X] create repo on git hub
   - [X] refactor participant requests to new page
   - [X] send request to sponsor/advisor (nodemailer)
   - [X] accept request (once sponsor and advisor accepted, internship "ready" for review
   - [X] determine and set internship status
   - [X] clean up code...get rid of damned tabs
   - [X] refactor sql queries to sanitize...safeguard against sql-injection
   - [X] edit internship should show student first and last name rather than logged in user
   - [X] advisor/sponsor should not be able to remove participant
   - [X] provide "cancel" button to student for active internships
   - [X] admin workflow to review "ready" internships and mark "approved"
   - [ ] remove participant should clear approved_on
   - [ ] display employment begin date for approved internship
   - [ ] make sure user is associated with internship before edit/review display
   - [ ] list activities and crud
   - [ ] activity comments
   - [ ] introduce validate user (confirm user associated with internship) logic before allowing edit/review
   - [ ] need to get message text included in participant request email
   - [ ] datepicker for activity schedule
   - [ ] html layout and css 
   - [ ] hash password clientside (and compare with confirmation at registration)
   - [ ] add clientside form validation for required fields and such
   - [ ] email reminders for upcoming scheduled activities
   - [ ] generate report (pdf?)
   - [ ] registration form should prolly have student number on it...rather than internship create (requires refactoring data model)
