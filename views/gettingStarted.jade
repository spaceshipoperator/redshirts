<p>Students can receive up to ten academic credits toward their degree for documented degree-related experience. Each five academic credits awarded must be deemed educationally equivalent to five hours of CSS or ITS elective coursework. Ten hours of credit typically requires one quarter of full-time commitment or two quarters of part-time commitment. A CSS/ITS faculty <b>advisor</b>, a senior professional mentor employed at a <b>sponsor</b> organization, and a CSS/ITS <b>student form</b> the internship team, and together they develop the detailed project plan. The plan must clearly identify the learning objectives and the program competencies that are further developed through participation in the internship. The CSS or ITS student will write a formal report detailing her/his project and her/his individual accomplishments. The report and an evaluation by the faculty advisor and senior professional mentor will determine the grade for the internship. This report will be a public document.</p>
