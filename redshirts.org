   Interns for the industry!

   To boldly go!
   
   A simple, little web application to manage the requirements for completing student internships.
   
** foundation
   In the course of "Managing Technical Teams" during Winter Quarter 2012 at the Univesity of Washington, Tacoma, a small group formed to automate the existing "paper" process followed by students, faculty advisors, industry sponsors and administrative staff to complete internships.
   
** considerations
   This application is intended to be the [[http://www.artima.com/intv/simplest.html]["simplest thing that could possibly work"]]
   
** resources
   - install [[http://nodejs.org/][node.js]], [[http://www.postgresql.org/download/][postgres]] and [[http://git-scm.com/download][git]]
   - at a command prompt: 
     #+begin_src sh
     git clone https://github.com/spaceshipoperator/redshirts.git

     cd redshirts

     npm install

     #+end_src
   - build the database (with script that will be provided)
   - start the app with `node app.js`

** implementation
   - [X] create repo on git hub
   - [X] refactor participant requests to new page
   - [X] send request to sponsor/advisor (nodemailer)
   - [X] accept request (once sponsor and advisor accepted, internship "ready" for review
   - [X] determine and set internship status
   - [X] clean up code...get rid of damned tabs
   - [X] refactor sql queries to sanitize...safeguard against sql-injection
   - [X] edit internship should show student first and last name rather than logged in user
   - [X] advisor/sponsor should not be able to remove participant
   - [X] provide "cancel" button to student for active internships
   - [X] admin workflow to review "ready" internships and mark "approved"
   - [X] list activities and crud
   - [X] datepicker for activity schedule
   - [X] activity comments
   - [X] delete associated comments on delete of activity
   - [X] display most recent posted on and contributor in activity list
   - [X] remove participant should clear approved_on
   - [X] display employment begin date for approved internship
   - [X] make sure user is associated with internship before edit/review display 
   - [X] if activity "scheduled on" upcoming within two days, status should be "milestone due"
   - [X] if "employment begin date" is today or earlier status should be "in progress"
   - [X] html layout and css 
   - [ ] add clientside form validation for required fields and such
   - [ ] email reminders for upcoming scheduled activities
   - [ ] need to get message text included in participant request email, some sane defaults for activities too
   - [ ] clean up background and fonts
   - [ ] content baby (home, faq, getting started)
   - [ ] include hints based on status, ie if pending "request an advisor and a sponsor...", 
   - [ ] require four scheduled activities before "ready"
   - [ ] hash password clientside (and compare with confirmation) at registration
   - [ ] lost password, reset recovery..
   - [ ] generate report (pdf?)
   - [ ] consider text box for submitting "entry code" on approve
   - [ ] registration form should prolly have student number on it...rather than internship create (requires refactoring data model..next release of app?)
