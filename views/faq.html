<h2><a name="option">What type of internships options are there?</a></h2>
<p><a name="conventional" style="font-weight:bold">Option 1: Conventional Internship</a><br/>
Students can choose from special projects proposed by any potential sponsor. The
Program Office will keep a list of current proposals. These have potential for
development into internships. They will be subject to specific conditions as
specified or negotiated by the sponsor and the CSS/ITS program. Each project must
demonstrate academic merit for the student and fit within her/his program
objectives. It will require approvals from a faculty advisor, the employer (the
internship sponsor), and CSS/ITS program. Furthermore, it must meet evaluation guidelines as
defined in the internship Contract.</p><a href="#contents">back to top.</a>

<p><a name="affiliate" style="font-weight:bold">Option 2: CSS/ITS Affiliate Internship</a><br/>
The CSS/ITS Program Office maintains a listing of CSS/ITS affiliates who are regular
internship sponsors, with company information, and active projects. A student may
select one of these projects and follow any application process specified. Each
project must demonstrate academic merit for the student and fit within her/his
program objectives. These competitive positions are subject to specific conditions
as specified by the sponsor and the CSS/ITS program. This requires approvals from a
faculty advisor, the employer (the Internship sponsor), and CSS/ITS program, and must
meet evaluation guidelines as defined in the internship Contract.</p><a href="#contents">back to top.</a>

<p><a name="currentemployer" style="font-weight:bold">Option 3: Current Employer Internship</a><br/>
Employed students may select to apply for an internship with their present
employer. Each project must demonstrate academic merit for the student and fit
within her/his program objectives. The effort must provide additional benefit to
both the student and employer (i.e., the project represents work that is above and
beyond what is normally expected by the employer). This requires approvals from
a faculty advisor, the employer (the Internship sponsor), and CSS/ITS program, and
must meet evaluation guidelines as defined in the internship contract.</p><a href="#contents">back to top.</a>

<p><a name="sponsor" style="font-weight:bold">Option 4: Sponsor Established Internship</a><br/>
Students may apply for an established internship program with a participating
company or organization through the standard application process for that
institution. Many of these opportunities are listed in the UWT Career Counseling
Center. Each project must demonstrate academic merit for the student and fit
within her/his program objectives. This requires approvals from a faculty advisor,
the employer (the Internship sponsor), and CSS/ITS program, and must meet
evaluation guidelines as defined in the Internship Contract.</p><a href="#contents">back to top.</a>

<p><a name="faculty" style="font-weight:bold">Option 5: Faculty Research Internship</a><br/>
A student may work with a faculty member on a research project that has
significant implications for industry and/or the community. Each project must
demonstrate academic merit for the student and fit within her/his program
objectives. At least one external internship sponsor and/or granting agency should
be identified as a reviewer of the work to be completed. This requires approvals
from a faculty advisor, the reviewer, and CSS/ITS program, and must meet evaluation
guidelines as defined in the Internship Contract.</p><a href="#contents">back to top.</a>

<p><a name="individual" style="font-weight:bold">Option 6: Individual Project - Student - Defined</a><br/>
A student may identify a computing project that she or he feels meets a need of
industry and/or the community. The student must identify at least one potential
customer (such as an Internship sponsor) who will agree to review the project and
sign the Internship Contract Agreement. Once this user has been identified, the
student must use appropriate software development methodologies to meet
deliverable requirements. The student must present the project to the customers
and the faculty advisor for final evaluation.</p><a href="#contents">back to top.</a>

<p><a name="group" style="font-weight:bold">Option 7: Group Project - Student - Defined</a><br/>
A group of students may identify a project that meets the requirements specified
in Option six above. This project, however, must be more complex in nature and
have sufficient academic and practical workload. A detailed project specification
and project plan including individual responsibilities and team milestones must
accompany your proposal for approval.</p><a href="#contents">back to top.</a>

<h2><a name="advisor">Who can be my faculty advisor?</a></h2>
<p>This ideally should be a faculty member who is familiar with the student, has been her or
her/his professor in a formal CSS/ITS course, and who is effectively willing to nominate her or
him for this project.</p><a href="#contents">back to top.</a>

<h2><a name="soa">What is the Statement of Agreement?</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.tacoma.uw.edu/sites/default/files/global/documents/institute_tech/statementofagreement.pdf">Statement of Agreement</a> is to inform the student, faculty advisor, and internship sponsor of each others responsiblities.</p>
<a href="#contents">back to top.</a>
<h2><a name="soaprinted">Where do I submit a printed copy of the Statement of Agreement?</a></h2>
<p>If you have printed out a copy of the Statement of Agreement and every party has signed the contract please submit the contract to PNK.</p>
<a href="#contents">back to top.</a>
<h2><a name="review">Who will review my internship form?</a></h2>
<p>The CSS/ITS Director will review all internship projects to make a final determination of
academic merit. Evaluation criteria will be reviewed to ensure they meet program
competency requirements.</p>
<a href="#contents">back to top.</a>
<h2><a name="enroll">How do I enroll in TCSS 497/TINFO 497?</a></h2>
<p>Once program approval is granted, the student receives an entry code to enroll in TCSS
497: Internship in CSS or TINFO 497: Internship in ITS for between 1 and 10 credits. Each credit requires four hours per week
of effort on the project for a ten week period (e.g., 5 credits requires 20 hours of effort on
the project for a ten week period -- a total of 100 hours).</p>
<a href="#contents">back to top.</a>
<h2><a name="credits">How can I get more or less than 5 credits for an internship?</a></h2>
<p>If you desire a different number of credits than the default of five credits for an internship contact your faculty advisor or Andrew Fry to discuss the appropriate amount of credits.</p>
<a href="#contents">back to top.</a>
<h2><a name="meeting">What should I bring to meetings with my faculty advisor?</a></h2>
<p>During the course of the quarter you will be required to meet with your faculty advisor at least four times or once every two weeks. During this meeting you and your faculty advisor should discuss project status, lessons learned, academic models addressed, and other issues associated with the completion of the Internship projects. Students are required to submit a written status report prior to each meeting. This report should clearly describe the status of the project(s) and the deliverables. Group project reports should clearly delineate each group memberï¿½s contributions and milestones, as well as summarizing group meetings. It should clearly describe and explain any barriers or slippages in the proposed schedule.</p>
<a href="#contents">back to top.</a>
<h2><a name="endofquarter">What do I do at the end of the quarter?</a></h2>
<p>Students prepare a quarterly status report and/or final report at the end of each quarter
for evaluation and grading by the faculty advisor in consultation with the internship sponsor.
The internship sponsor should review the quarterly status report and/or final report to
insure there is no breach of confidentiality before the report is submitted.</p>
<a href="#contents">back to top.</a>
<h2><a name="presentation">When and where is my end of quarter presentation?</a></h2>
<p>In order to have completed the TCSS 497/TINFO 497 requirements, students present their work at a
UWT CSS/ITS colloquium. Two weeks before the end of the quarter or approximately eight weeks after the start of the internship the student will receive an email reminding them of their upcoming colloquim and that it is the student's and faculty advisor's responsibility to coordinate and schedule an appropriate time for the presentation. Colloquim will be scheduled each quarter as required.</p>
<a href="#contents">back to top.</a>
<h2><a name="grade">How is my internship graded?</a></h2>
<p>The faculty advisor will evaluate the final project and determine the grade according to
the criteria agreed on in the internship Proposal. The grade will include the quality of the
report and the presentation.</p><a href="#contents">back to top.</a>
